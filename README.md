# Learn Ramda

An interactive guide to learning Ramda and functional programming in JS.

## Requirements
- Node 10.0.0 and above

## Getting Started
You will only have to do this once per computer you wish to work on this project.

1. Open a terminal
2. Run `cd ~/Projects` or whereever your projects directory is located
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/eccentric-j/learn-ramda.git`
4. Run `cd learn-ramda`
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `npm test`

Now open up `courses/1-ramda-basics/1-intro.js` in your editor.
Answer questions, fix tests, and come up with logic to make each test pass.
As you save your files the tests should rerun to make it as fast as possible.
